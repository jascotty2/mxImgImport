v1.5 (6/10/12)
- added dynamic color loading to match a custom texture pack
-- loads colors from terrain.png in the plugin's data folder
-- seperate color data for top and side images
-- if none found, reverts to old behavior
--- TODO: load from image in jar if not found
--- add command (or autodetect) to reload new colors (if changing out the texture image)
--- add preferences file to define what blocks are allowed

v1.4 (6/9/12)
- updated for new bukkit system
- added smarter file handling
-- checks for file before executing command
-- auto-completion
- adeded image scaling
-- option for legacy full-image import with 'f'
- fixed import direction (more logical for me, at least)
-- first point is bottom-left, 2nd is upper-right
-- fixed north/south flat images
- cleaned up help text
- removed jpg restriction - they look fine to me..
